### Reactive Bitcoin
Simple application for demostration of how to use Android Architecture Components(ViewModel, LiveData, Room). UI automatically updates when data changes in the database using DataBinding.
Dependency management is based on Dagger 2.10+.
RxJava is used for easy asynchronous fetching of data from API and updating data in the database.

Used [blockchain.info](https://https://blockchain.info/) Open API.
